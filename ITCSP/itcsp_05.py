Exercise 05
Write a program that will calculate circle area (and print to the terminal), 
radius is 5 cm, 
lets's assume pi = 3.14
A=𝜋𝑟^2 (this is our formula)
expected result: e.g., 

"Circle area is: 78.5 cm2"

'''

r = 5
pi = 3.14
formula = pi * (r ** 2)

print("Circle area is: " + str(formula) + " cm2")
